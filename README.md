# Queue Simulation Modelling for Driver's License (SIM) Service at Police Station Using MATLAB Simulink

## Project Overview

This project simulates the queueing system for the driver's license (SIM) service at a police station using MATLAB Simulink. The goal is to model and analyze the flow of customer arrivals, service processes, and waiting times in order to optimize the performance and efficiency of the system.

The simulation is built using MATLAB Simulink, allowing for a visual and dynamic representation of the queueing system. By simulating various conditions, such as different arrival rates, service times, and number of servers, this project aims to provide insights into how to minimize waiting times and improve overall service quality.

## Key Features

- **Queue Simulation:** Models the arrival of customers (applicants) and their waiting time in the queue for different stages of the driver's license service.
- **Service Process:** Simulates the entire process of creating a driver's license, including document verification, photo capturing, and other necessary procedures.
- **Performance Metrics:** Measures key performance indicators such as average waiting time, service utilization, and the number of people in the queue.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Allows for modification of parameters such as the number of service counters, service time distribution, and customer arrival rates.
- **Scalability:** Can simulate different scales of customer flow, from low traffic periods to peak times.

## Why I made this Project

The creation of this project was driven by the need to improve the service experience at police stations when applying for or renewing a driver's license. Long waiting times and inefficient service processes can lead to frustration for applicants. By analyzing the current system using queueing theory and simulation, potential bottlenecks can be identified, and strategies for optimizing the system can be proposed.

## Software Requirements

- MATLAB (with Simulink)
- Basic knowledge of queueing theory and simulation modeling

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the Simulink model and configure the simulation parameters as needed.

## How to Use

1. Open the file extension `.slx` file in MATLAB Simulink.
2. Modify the input parameters such as:
   - Number of service counters
   - Arrival rates

3. Run the simulation to observe the queue dynamics and analyze the performance metrics.
4. Use the results to propose optimizations for reducing waiting time and improving service flow.

## Conclusion

This queue simulation project provides a valuable tool for analyzing and improving the efficiency of the driver's license service process at police stations. By testing different scenarios in a simulated environment, decision-makers can make data-driven improvements to the system.
